Final Project 


#Project Idea 

- I will be inserting how I planned this project, although.... I refactored many many times unfortunately so I could not capture every step.

### What went wrong and if I fixed it, how I did so:
- The first page I created in the drawing was not what I thought it would look like at all. Once I had created it I stared at it and stared at it and moved on cause I thought it was enough.... until I realized I hated it. I did this a few times and scrapped the entire website layout and color scheme a few times. I just could not figure out how to make it professional and the youtube vids and documents I was finding were not what I had envisioned so I spent way too much time doing CSS and HTML from scratch (as in not using SASS or any templates/examples) just to figure out I hated the first page and redoing it the day of the due date. I used some examples and fit them to my vision of the site but some of the JS was hard to not "copy" since it was exactly what I had wanted in the first place. 
- I had a lot of trouble inserting pictures and logos I have no idea what is wrong I tried everything I could think of and just could not do it. I found a way to use the logos without font aweseom since I wasted too much time trying to make that work. 
- I started off scripting using Python socket and got it to work then it broke and I could not even comprehend the error so I switched to node since there were more reserouces.

# Final-Project-Cs290
Final Project 


#READ BEFORE OPENING FILES

I know a lot of files but I will say which goes with what cause I made way too many and confused myself like I love to do :,(

SERVER/CLIENT SIDE SCRIPTING (1)
- client.py
- server.py 
(These do pretty much nothing they kept breaking so I left the frame and am probably not going to mess with it anymore,
  I just them in there incase I wanted to mess with them later.) 
 
PRODUCT PAGE AND ELEMENTS
- Procuct.Html is main page
  - Stylesheet.css
- Creation.Html is gutted page with some content
- Prod.Html is gutted page as well 
- Mailing.Html I am keeping and making work better listed under /files
  - Mailing also will be connected to success and fail 
  - app.js is also connected 
  - package.json 
  - package-lock.json
  - bootstrap.css


I am posting updated page remodel soon today 3/19/22




## Project Idea 

- I will be inserting how I planned this project, although.... I refactored many many times unfortunately so I could not capture every step. I ended up changing the layouts of the pages to fit what I thought would make more sense. I also ended up finding resources that gave me a better way to do things so I would just scrap what I had and do it the "better way". I did not expect to find so may API's the challenge really was figuring out how to use them.

### First Page: What went wrong and if I fixed it, how I did so:
- The first page I created in the drawing was not what I thought it would look like at all. Once I had created it I stared at it and stared at it and moved on cause I thought it was enough.... until I realized I hated it. I did this a few times and scrapped the entire website layout and color scheme a few times. I just could not figure out how to make it professional and the youtube vids and documents I was finding were not what I had envisioned so I spent way too much time doing CSS and HTML from scratch (as in not using SASS or any templates/examples) just to figure out I hated the first page and redoing it the day of the due date. I used some examples and fit them to my vision of the site but some of the JS was hard to not "copy" since it was exactly what I had wanted in the first place. 
- I had a lot of trouble inserting pictures and logos I have no idea what is wrong I tried everything I could think of and just could not do it. I found a way to use the logos without font aweseom since I wasted too much time trying to make that work. 
- I started off scripting using Python socket and got it to work then it broke and I could not even comprehend the error so I switched to node since there were more reserouces. 
- Also, I could not get a single image to show up for me, I tried to have someone help me and they also could not figure it out. 

### What went good:
- I was able to add more and make it look a bit more like a decent looking page. I learned a lot of formatting stuff and am gunna redo the entire page AGAIN after this class because I really love it and want to learn more about scripting as it is the only thing I really am not sure about. 

## Second Page: What went wrong and if I fixed it, how I did so: 
- I don't think I kept the form of this page as I just did not have a lot to say about it. We did not get as much content as I thought we would so I made it a dummy page. I kinda just took some of the attributes I wanted to add and added them. 
### What went good:
- I was able to know how to quickly throw a bit of stuff on the page and make it look alright.

## Third Page: Page: What went wrong and if I fixed it, how I did so: 
- I ended up changing my mind on this and did not like what I origianlly came up with as it had no practical use. I think I focused way too much on the look and practicalness of this site rather than what needed to be shown. I regret putting my time toward the style so much.... well I do and I don't as I learned a lot but hope to learn more about JS and server/client side scripting. 

### What went good:
- Nothing I hated everything I did and wish I would have just stuck with what I came up with despite how much I hated it. I spent about two full weeks on this project with not much to show (in my opinion idk if I did enough or not)

## Compare websiteâ€™s that I did and did not like before 
I belive I did Amazon as one I liked and Depop as one I did not like
- What I took from sites I liked was the bubbles on the front page and the top nav bar with a search button. Those were some must have components for me and I really wanted a specific layout, but found that I hated the layout when I did it. What I did to make sure to not have it like the sites I hated was make sure each tab or section was very obvious as to what it was and what it would lead to. I wish I had added more functionality to the page, I just did not have time as I spent it redoing the style a million times.

## I could have done better to make mine better and what I wish I would have done 

I realllly wish I would have done more research on how to make the page professional and smooth. I really hate the way my page functions and am very frusturated by the scripting aspect. I want to have more of a professional layout and also have a page that I am proud of. I did not deliver when it came to that and will be fixing it over break because I am desperate to make it work. I actually found myself to be very passionate about web dev and have always thought I would hate it, but there are so many amazing applications that I would like to explore and I find myself inspecting every website I go to now.








# REDESIGN OF WEBSITE

### Idea of design 

- I initially wanted to have a mostly monochromatic website and what I initially did was something I hated and felt like was very plain and ugly
  I changed it to something that was more fitting to the product I had done and still hated it. So what I wanted to do is use what I had and 
  redesign what I had done to be more interesting and highlight myself and my key interests.
